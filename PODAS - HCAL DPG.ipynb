    "## Introduction\n",
    "The HCAL detectors were designed to measure the energy of neutral and charged particles originating from quark fragmentation and hadronization. Optical signals produced by particle interactions in the HB and HE scintillators or HF quartz fibers are carried through clear fibers to Silicon PhotoMultipliers (SiPMs) or Photomultiplier Tubes (PMTs), where they are converted to electric signals. Then, the analog signals from the photo-detectors are converted to digital signals by an electric circuit called the QIE (charge Integrator and Encoder). The QIE collects the charge produced by the photo-detectors, integrates it over 25ns interval and digitizes the signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pulse shape in HCAL\n",

If it happens that the peak is 25 ns earlier or later (i.e. in TS3 or TS5), HCAL will assign the hit to the wrong bunch crossing. We will come back to this when we talk about out-of-time pile-up.\n",

    "# Session 4: Isotrack Calibration\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "The real detector geometry differs from the testbeam geometry where calibration factors were extracted for the first time. Therefore, HCAL experts use several methods to recalibrate the detector. One of the recalibration methods is to use Isolated Charged Hadrons. This exercise will briefly describe how this recalibration is done in HCAL.\n",
    "## Calibratio method\n",
    "CMS has a very powerful magnet, the momentum measured by the tracker is accurate. The tracker measures the momentum of charged particles through their curvature. If a particle is very high energy, it will appear like a straight line to the tracker. Therefore, the curvature will be very little and the measurement of momentum is not accurate. This is where the measurement of energy by HCAL is more precise than the momentum measured by the tracker. Obviously, HCAL is also used to measure the energy of neutral hadrons that can't be done by the tracker.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although radiation damages HCAL, it has no effect on the magnetic field, therefore, the energy measured by the tracker can be used as a reference for HCAL calibration. This method of calibration uses “isolated charged hadrons” for calibration because:\n",
    "- Charged: Obviously, if we want to use the magnetic field to measure the energy of a particle, that particle should have charge.\n",
    "- Isolated: We require the particle to be isolated from other particles to ensure minimal contamination from unrelated energy depositions.\n",
    "- Hadron: We would like the particle to deposit its energy in HCAL, therefore the particle should be a hadron.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low and high energy isolated charged hadrons are not desirable in the calibration. Because:\n",
    "- HCAL has a non-linear response with respect to the initial energy of the hadrons which is more prominent at lower energies. Therefore, we don’t want to consider low energy hadrons.\n",
    "- There is only a low number of isolated hadrons with high energy as the energy spectrum falls down with increasing energy.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this reason, an energy of 50 GeV is chose and only particles with momenta between 40-60 GeV are considered.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Measurement uncertainties\n",
    "Now that we know how we want to calibrate HCAL, let’s look at the uncertainties of measuring energy/momentum in HCAL/tracker. There are a few sources of uncertainty measuring the energy of isolated charged hadrons:\n",
    "- Primary vertex and track reconstruction quality:Tracks are required to have an associated primary vertex and to have the track quality bit set to “high purity”.\n",
    "- Interaction of hadrons with ECAL:The hadron calorimeter does not measure the entire energy of particles. The particles can interact and deposit a substantial part of their energy in the preceding electromagnetic calorimeter (ECAL) or other dead material before the hadron calorimeter. The depth of ECAL is about one nuclear interaction length and more than half of hadrons undergo inelastic interaction in the ECAL. In order to have better accuracy, hadrons that have had high interaction with ECAL are not considered. This is ensured by requiring that the energy measured in ECAL in a cone of radius 14 cm around the impact point of the track to be less than 1 GeV."

Look at the tails in the plots. Although the central part of the plot is Gaussian, the long tails on either side don’t look Gaussian. The tail on the lower side may be due to non-containment of the hadron shower in the HCAL and the tail on the higher side is most likely due to overlap of showers from some neighboring particles in the jet (most likely neutral ones).\n",

Look at plots “respMean” and “respFit”. Can you explain what the difference is between these two plots? Look at all the plots again. Do you understand all of them? Guess what other plots are from their title. The “chi2/ndf” plot is chi-square divided by NDF (Number of Degrees of Freedom). Chi-square is a test for the goodness of a fit. What does “chi2/ndf” plot tell you?"

And if the energy deposition outside the cone is caused by the particle itself, the true energy will be higher than that reconstructed in the cone. We use a 70-cm wide (Rcone = 35 cm) cone when measuring the energy of particles. If there is any energy deposition from a nearby track in our 70-cm wide cone, the energy beyond the cone (radius > Rcone) should be higher than normal.\n",

Therefore, the correction for low-energy showers should be suppressed with respect to high-energy ones."
